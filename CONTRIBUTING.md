# Reporting Issues and Making Pull Requests

When Reporting an Issue:

Before you create an issue for features, bugs, or improvements, please take the following steps:

1. Search for Existing Issues: First, check if someone else has already reported the same issue. Avoid duplication.
Provide Context: When creating a new issue, please give us as 
2. much context as possible. Be sure to select the correct issue type, such as "bug" or "feature," to help us understand your concern.

### Working on an Issue (Getting It Assigned)

When working on an existing issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Request Assignment for One Issue at a Time:** Ask to be assigned to just one issue at a time to focus your efforts.
2. **Request Assignment by Commenting:** Ask for the issue to be assigned to you by leaving a comment. Avoid tagging maintainers on GitHub, as maintainers receive comment notifications.
3. **Start Working After Assignment:** Once the issue is assigned to you, you can begin working on it.
4. **Focus on Assigned Issue:** Work exclusively on the assigned issue and open a pull request when ready. This prevents confusion and multiple people working on the same problem.
5. **Reference the Issue in Your Pull Request:** In your pull request, reference the issue, such as "closes #123."

By following these steps, you'll help streamline the development process and avoid unnecessary complications.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Everyone is encouraged to review pull requests. It's a chance to learn, connect, and support each other.
